# AGame

This is my AGame Webiste, that I have created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python code using Django and then deployed on Heroku. 
This website is intended for users to be able to be able to sign up for a Game subscription that will then enable them to download and then
play games, they will also be able to shop on the merchandise store. all while using having an account that can track their subscription status
and also view their account order history and cancel their subscription.

# UX

### **Project Goals**

The Aim of my project was to be able to create a site where the user could go to find games to play and then pay a small subscription fee to play them,
they could also shop on the merhandise store and be able to purchase products from this, and with a "PRO" subscription they would also get
10% off on the store and also free delivery as a perk to go from the free subscription to the PRO version. along with this they would also need
a profile account that they could login with, and with this track their order history and be able to cancel their subscription as they wish.

### **Design**

Most of the design of my website came from inspiration from another Game subscription website such as 
[Xbox Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass)
This sites helped with the information that I was going to need and the layout of my website.

### layout

The Layout of the site was using a Grid formation and layout taken from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) webiste, 
this webiste was designed heavily off the back of the Boutique Ado mini project, that was done just before this milestone project,
As I feel this had the perfect base layout for creating my webiste and a mobile first approach.

### Fonts

The fonts that I decided to use was "Roboto Slab" and "Sans serif" as a backup and found this using 
[Google fonts website](https://fonts.google.com/) Which worked well from my previous Project.

### Colours

The Colours were found from a website called [Color Combos](https://www.colorcombos.com/color-schemes/2026/ColorCombo2026.html)
the colours used were purple, grey and mostly a light blue as it complemented my AGame Logo.

### Icons

The Icons used on this site were taken from the website [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### WireFrames

The wireframes were created using the Balsamiq application, you can view my PDF of the wireframes
that were created at the beginning of this project and have not been modified based on the final look of the website.
