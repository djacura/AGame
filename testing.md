## Development Testing

Using Django Framework comes with a very useful Debug function, that when When Debug is True. If there is an error in the code the live server will stop and print out an error code. \
This is printed out in the terminal and on the localhost. And because of this feature a lot of the bugs get fixed as they happen. so there arent that many which is good.
